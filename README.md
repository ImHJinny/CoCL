# CoCL
CoCL: EEG Connectivity-guided Contrastive Learning for Seizure Detection

#### About the notebook
First, set the paths in \*.json files. Copy files in folder "copy-to-CHBMIT-folder" to your CHBMIT dataset folder.
- `[1]data_prepro_labeling.ipynb` notebooks show the preprocessing of CHB-MIT dataset and the labeling of connectivity-guided.
- `[2]pretrained (CoCL).ipynb` notebooks show the connectivity-guided contrastive learning framework (CoCL) proposed in the paper.
- `[3]downstream_task.ipynb` notebooks show the performance of the seizure detection task using CoCL.
